# 👋 Hey, I'm Ariel

Hi! I’m Ariel, a developer specializing in custom Minecraft plugins, unique game mechanics, and server-side tooling. I’ve collaborated with small servers and individual clients to bring their ideas to life through clean, efficient code and solid design.

I specialize in:
- 🧱 Custom Minecraft plugins (Spigot, Paper)
- ⚙️ Server setup tools and gameplay systems (perms, kits, configs, and more)
- 🤖 Discord bots for server integration
- 🐍 Tools & utilities in Python (automation, scraping, scripting)
- 📱 Android & Desktop apps (side projects mostly)
