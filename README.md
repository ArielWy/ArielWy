# 👋 Ariel | Developer from Israel

Hi! I'm Ariel, a developer who enjoys making Minecraft plugins, small tools, and software experiments with Python, Kotlin, and other languages. I love turning ideas into working projects — especially when they're fun or useful.

🛠️ I usually work on:
- Custom Minecraft plugins (Spigot, Paper, Fabric)
- Tools and utilities in Python
- Android apps and desktop scripts

🚀 Some of my projects:
- [ChunkEraser](https://github.com/ArielWy/ChunkEraser) – Minecraft minigame where chunks vanish over time
- [Mentor](https://github.com/ArielWy/Mentor) – AI-powered project-based coding assistant
- [Linker](https://github.com/ArielWy/Linker) – Connect your Minecraft server with Discord using a plugin

📬 Open to feedback, ideas, or collabs!
