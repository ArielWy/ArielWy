# 👋 Ariel

Hi! I'm usually making here Minecraft plugins,small tools, and software experiments with Python, Kotlin, Java, and other languages. I love turning ideas into working projects — especially when they're fun or useful.

🛠️ I usually work on:
- Custom Minecraft plugins
- Discord bots
- Tools and utilities in Python
- Android apps and desktop scripts

🚀 Some of my projects:
- [ChunkEraser](https://github.com/ArielWy/ChunkEraser) – Minecraft minigame where chunks vanish over time
-



📬 Open to feedback, ideas, or collabs!
